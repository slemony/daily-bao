# The Daily Bao 报 — Claude Context

## What this is
A personal news reader web app that replaces social media. Free, cloud-hosted on Firebase, accessible on any device. Each user logs in with Google and manages their own RSS feed list.

## Tech stack
- **Frontend**: Vanilla HTML + CSS + JS (no build tools, no framework)
- **Auth**: Firebase Auth — Google Sign-in only
- **Database**: Firestore — stores per-user feed config (`/users/{uid}` → `{ feeds: [...], categories: [...] }`). `categories` is the list of user-created section names, including empty ones that have no feeds yet
- **Hosting**: Firebase Hosting (`firebase deploy`)
- **RSS fetching**: Client-side — direct fetch + 3 CORS proxies (allorigins, codetabs, cors.lol) raced with `Promise.any`, 8s timeout; rss2json.com as final fallback if all fail
- **RSS parsing**: `rss-parser@3` loaded from jsDelivr CDN (global `RSSParser`); handles `content:encoded`, Atom `<content>`, CDATA, Media RSS
- **Article reader**: Mozilla Readability.js loaded from jsDelivr CDN (preloaded silently after first feed fetch)
- **Article cache**: `localStorage` key `dailybao_feed_cache` — same-day cache, stale-while-revalidate on new day
- **YouTube shorts cache**: `localStorage` key `dailybao_yt_short_cache` — maps `videoId` → `isShort` boolean, populated via YouTube oEmbed thumbnail aspect ratio, capped at 2000 entries (FIFO trim)
- **Read-progress store**: `localStorage` key `dailybao_read_progress` — maps article `link` → `{pct, scrollTop, scrollHeight, elapsedMs, lastAt, …article meta}`, 42h TTL, deleted when pct ≥ 0.95. Populated by the reader scroll listener; `purgeExpiredProgress()` runs on auth
- **Podcast audio state**: `localStorage` key `dailybao_audio_state` — playback position + rate, saved every 3s during playback

## File structure
```
index.html       — app shell (login page + full SPA in one file)
style.css        — all styling, dark/light theme via [data-theme] on <html>
app.js           — all logic: Firebase, RSS parsing, Readability, UI
manifest.json    — PWA manifest (app icon, theme colour, standalone mode)
firebase.json    — Firebase Hosting + Firestore config
firestore.rules  — security rules (users own only their own doc)
.firebaserc      — Firebase Project ID reference
README.md        — setup guide for deploying to Firebase
```

## Key design decisions
- **No build step** — deploy with `firebase deploy`, edit files directly
- **CI/CD** — pushing to `main` on GitHub auto-deploys to Firebase Hosting via GitHub Actions
- **No backend / Cloud Functions** — stays on Firebase free Spark plan
- **CORS proxies raced in parallel** — all three proxies fire simultaneously; fastest response wins
- **localStorage article cache** — same-day loads skip network entirely; stale cache shows instantly then refreshes in background
- **Progressive feed rendering** — articles appear in UI as each feed resolves, not after all finish
- **Incremental refresh** — manual refresh and background refresh merge new articles by URL dedup; nothing is flushed
- **Firestore stores config only** — articles are never written to Firestore
- **Single `app.js`** — all logic in one file intentionally; don't split unless it exceeds ~800 lines
- **Theme persists via localStorage** — default is light (warm newspaper palette); user preference remembered across sessions
- **Whole card is clickable** — article cards have no "Read →" button; clicking anywhere on the card opens the reader

## Article card design (Reeder-style)
Each `.article-card` shows:
- Top row: circular favicon (Google favicon API `?domain=…&sz=64`), feed name, author (`item.creator` / `dc:creator`), date
- Body row: title + summary (left, flex), thumbnail (right, 76×76px, `object-fit: cover`)
- Thumbnail sourced from: YouTube thumbnail > media:thumbnail > first `<img src>` in content
- `feedDomain` and `author` are extracted at parse time in `parseRSS()` / `parseRss2json()` and stored on each article object

## Feed source filter
- `activeFeed` global (null = show all) — set by clicking a feed's name in the settings panel
- Clicking closes the panel, filters `renderFeed()` to that feed's articles, and smooth-scrolls the page to the top
- When active, `#feed-filter-chip` appears inline in the header next to "The Daily Bao" — shows `· [name] ✕`; clicking ✕ clears the filter and scrolls to top
- Active feed item is highlighted with `.feed-item-active` class
- Scroll-to-top is only wired to filter clicks, NOT inside `renderFeed()` — background refresh must not disrupt scroll position

## Podcast audio player
- `<div id="audio-player">` in `index.html` is a persistent sticky bottom bar with a hidden `<audio id="audio-el">` inside. Survives reader dismissal — the user can browse the feed while listening
- Articles expose `article.audio = {url, type, length}` when an RSS `<enclosure>` with `type="audio/*"` (or no type) is found. Parsed in both `parseRSS()` (rss-parser: `item.enclosure.url`) and `parseRss2json()` (rss2json: `item.enclosure.link`)
- Podcast cards show a `🎧 Podcast` badge; the reader renders a `🎧 Play podcast` button above the article. Opening a podcast article auto-starts playback (user gesture from the card click satisfies autoplay policy)
- `playPodcast(article)`, `togglePodcast()`, `closePodcast()` manage state. Controls: play/pause, back 15s, forward 30s, rate toggle (1/1.25/1.5/2/0.75×), close, scrubber
- **MediaSession API** registered (`play`, `pause`, `seekbackward`, `seekforward`, `seekto`, `stop`) for lock-screen / notification / bluetooth remote controls. Metadata (title, artist=feedName, album=section, artwork=thumbnail) set on every track load
- `body.audio-active` adds bottom padding to `#feed-container` and `.reader-body` so the sticky bar doesn't cover content

## Read progress / Continue Reading
- Scroll in `.reader-body` is tracked by `startReadSession(article)` which sets up a scroll listener + 5s timer. `persistProgress()` writes to `dailybao_read_progress` only when elapsed reading time ≥ 60s AND pct < 0.95. When pct crosses 0.95, the entry is deleted (article finished)
- `endReadSession()` is called on reader back, backdrop dismiss, `pagehide`, and the next `openReader` call. Visibility changes pause/resume the elapsed-time counter
- On reader open, `restoreProgressScroll(article)` re-applies the saved scroll position on next animation frame using the current `scrollHeight` × saved `pct` (falls back to raw `scrollTop` if no dimensions)
- Side panel "📖 Continue reading" block (`#continue-reading-block`) is hidden when empty; otherwise shows unfinished articles sorted by `lastAt desc`, each with title, feed, %, last-read time, delete ✕ button. Clicking re-opens the reader from cached metadata so it works even if the article has fallen out of `allArticles`

## Body scroll lock
- `body.body-locked { overflow: hidden }` prevents the background feed's scrollbar from showing through the reader or settings panel. Toggled by `openPanel`, `openModal`, `closePanel`, `closeModal`, and `updateBodyLock()` (called whenever any overlay closes)

## Section / tag system
- Each feed has a `section` field — a free-form string (e.g. "World News", "Tech & AI", anything user types)
- Sections are user-defined: the section input in add/edit modals is a text field with `<datalist id="sections-datalist">` showing existing section names as suggestions
- `renderTabs()` builds nav tabs dynamically from unique sections in `userFeeds`; `updateSectionsDatalist()` keeps the datalist in sync — both called after any feed add/edit/delete/load
- Section tabs (`#section-tabs`) and language filter (`#lang-filter`) are currently hidden (`class="hidden"`) — sections are managed via settings panel only
- Each section header in settings has a `✎` rename button (hover to reveal) — renames all feeds in that section in bulk; empty categories also show a 🗑 button to delete them
- Clicking a section label in the settings panel filters the feed to that section (sets `activeSection`), closes the panel, and shows the section chip in the header with a ✕ clear button. Same chip slot is reused for both feed and section filters (only one active at a time)
- A **`+ New category`** button below the feed list lets users add empty categories (e.g. Sports, Gaming) that persist in Firestore `categories[]` even before any feeds use them
- Feed items are HTML5-draggable within and across categories. Dropping on a feed item reorders it (above/below based on cursor Y) and reassigns its `section` to the target's section. Visual drop indicators via `.feed-item.drop-above` / `.drop-below`
- `sectionLabel(s)` is a pass-through (`return s`) — no emoji mapping
- `isCreator` is URL-based: YouTube (`youtube.com/feeds`) or XHS (`rsshub.app/xiaohongshu`, `rsshub.app/xhslink`) or legacy `feed.section === 'Creators'`

## Settings panel — feed item actions
- **"+ Add" button** is in the panel header (compact pill, not full-width row)
- Edit and Delete buttons are hidden by default (`opacity: 0; pointer-events: none`)
- **Desktop**: buttons fade in on `.feed-item:hover`
- **Mobile**: long-press (600ms touchstart timer) adds `.actions-visible` class; tapping outside clears it
- Clicking the feed name area filters by that feed (separate from the action buttons)
- **Mobile swipe**: swipe from the right edge of the screen (within 30px) leftward 60px+ opens settings panel

## Mobile UX
- Swipe right-edge → open settings: touch starts at `startX > window.innerWidth - 30`, drag left ≥ 60px
- Swipe left-edge of open panel → dismiss: existing `addSwipeToDismiss()` on `#settings-panel`
- Modals (`#add-feed-modal`, `#edit-feed-modal`) are `max-height: 90vh` with scrollable `.modal-body` — header and footer stay pinned

## Panel & reader dismissal
- `#panel-backdrop` click closes both `.side-panel.open` AND `.reader-panel.open` — on desktop the reader is a 60vw right slide-over, so clicking the dimmed left area dismisses it
- `hidePanelBackdrop()` checks for any remaining open panel/reader before hiding the backdrop

## Reader image handling
- `.reader-prose img` has `height: auto; width: auto` — prevents stretching from explicit HTML attributes
- `cleanReaderContent()` strips inline `width`/`height` attributes and styles from all `<img>` tags after the lazy-load replacement pass
- Also dedupes images by normalized src (strips query string, Vox-style `-NNNN` size suffixes, `/WxH/` resize segments) — fixes Verge articles that render the hero image twice; removes the parent `<figure>` if it becomes empty
- Strips empty `<li>` elements (no text, no media) and any `<ul>`/`<ol>` that end up empty — fixes stray bullet dots in Verge articles

## Firebase config
The `FIREBASE_CONFIG` object at the top of `app.js` is a placeholder. User fills it in from Firebase Console → Project Settings → Your Apps. Do not commit real API keys.

## YouTube & XHS support
- YouTube: standard Atom feed `https://www.youtube.com/feeds/videos.xml?channel_id=CHANNEL_ID`
- XHS: via RSSHub public instance `https://rsshub.app/xiaohongshu/user/{userid}`
- XHS URL auto-detection handles: `xiaohongshu.com/user/profile/{id}`, `rednote.com/user/profile/{id}`, `xhslink.com/m/{short}` (phone share — resolved via allorigins redirect)
- **YouTube shorts filter**: each YouTube feed has a `ytFilter` field on its feed object — `'all' | 'long' | 'shorts'` (default `'all'`). Set via radio group inside `#youtube-helper` (add modal) and `#edit-yt-filter-group` (edit modal); only visible when the URL includes `youtube.com/feeds`
- Shorts are detected by `getYtIsShort(videoId)` — calls YouTube oEmbed (`https://www.youtube.com/oembed?url=…&format=json`) and checks `thumbnail_height > thumbnail_width`. Results cached in localStorage (see Tech stack). `null` return means unknown → kept when filtering long-form (so detection misses don't vanish) but dropped when filtering shorts-only
- `applyYtFilter(articles, feed)` runs at the end of `parseRSS()` and `parseRss2json()` — no-op unless the feed is a YouTube feed with `ytFilter !== 'all'`

## Feed debug log
- `feedLogs` array in `app.js` records per-feed OK/error with timestamp on every fetch
- Accessible via Settings → Feed Logs → View, or by clicking the `⚠ N feeds failed` chip in the header
- `openDebugModal()` renders the log; `updateLogsSummary()` updates the settings hint text

## UI personality / copy to preserve
- Splash screen silly one-liners (`SPLASH_MSGS` array in app.js) — add more, never remove
- Loading overlay messages (`LOADING_MSGS` array) — same rule
- Theme toggle labels: "☀️ Cope" (dark mode button) · "🌙 Vibe" (light mode button)
- App logo: 🍞 emoji, "The Daily Bao" in DM Serif Display font

## What the user cares about
- No ads, no redirects — article reader must strip to clean text
- Works on mobile and PC without login friction
- Easy to add any news source (paste URL → auto-detect RSS); edit existing sources with live RSS test
- Fun, irreverent UI personality — keep the humor in loading messages and empty states
- Free hosting — do not introduce paid services or Cloud Functions

## What to avoid
- Do not add a build step (Webpack, Vite, etc.) unless user explicitly asks
- Do not split into multiple JS files without asking
- Do not add Cloud Functions — keep everything on the free Spark plan
- Do not store articles in Firestore — only user feed config
- Do not remove the personality copy (loading messages, tagline)
